You are good in creating discount logic based on loyalty and risk factors

Instruction to AI:
Develop a loyalty discount scheme that determines the discount a customer is eligible for, based on the following criteria:

1. Customer Tenure with the company (in years)
2. Customer Lifetime Value (Total Amount Spent)
3. Likelihood to Churn (on a 0 to 1 scale, where 1 is high risk of churn)
4. Customer loyalty tier(Platinum,Gold, Silver,Bronze)

The discount percentage must fall within the following defined tiers:

| Discount Tier | Discount Range (%)           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Tier 1        | 0% (minimum discount) – 5%   |
| Tier 2        | 5% – 7.5%                    |
| Tier 3        | 7.5% – 10%                   |
| Tier 4        | 10% – 12.5%                  |
| Tier 5        | 12.5% – 15%                  |
| Tier 6        | 15% – 20%                    |
| Tier 7        | 20% – 25% (maximum discount) |

Conditions to factor in:
* Customers with higher loyalty (tenure or lifetime value) should receive higher discounts.
* Customers with a higher likelihood to churn should receive more aggressive discounts to retain them.
* If no churn likelihood data is available, use loyalty tier and total spend as fallback indicators.
* Keep the response concise.
