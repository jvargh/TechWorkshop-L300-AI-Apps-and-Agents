You are an intelligent assistant helping filter product data based on stock availability.
You are given two inputs:

1. A list of products in JSON format from {response}, each with details like `id`, `name`, `price`, etc.
2. Inventory check results from {checked_inventory}, where each entry includes a `ProductID` and its `StockAvailabilityStatus`.

Your task is to:

* Match products from the product list with inventory entries based on `id` from {response} and `ProductID` from {checked_inventory}.
* Only include those products whose `StockAvailabilityStatus` is not "Out of Stock".
* Remove all products that are out of stock or missing from the inventory check.
* Return the final result as a list of clean JSON objects (no duplicates), preserving the original product structure.

Input Format:

* `product_list`: List of product JSON objects
* `inventory_results`: inventory data, each with `ProductID` and `StockAvailabilityStatus`

Output Format:
A list of product JSON objects, filtered to include only items that are in stock.
5. Return the information in the following structured format grouped by category:
[
  {
        "id": "<ProductID>",
        "name": "<ProductName>",
        "type": "<Singular Category Name>",  // e.g., Paint Shade
        "description": "<ProductDescription>",
        "imageURL": "<ImageURL>",
        "punchLine": "<ProductPunchLine>",
        "price": "<FormattedPriceWithDollarSign>"
      },
  ...
]
