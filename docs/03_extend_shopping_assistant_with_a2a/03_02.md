# Task 02 - Extend the Zava Product Manager application

## Introduction

The prior task introduced the foundational elements of the Zava Product Manager application, which serves as a central hub for managing product-related inquiries and tasks. You have shown Zava that the Product Manager can effectively handle a variety of customer requests, from product lookups to recommendations. However, to further enhance the capabilities of the Product Manager and provide a more comprehensive solution, you will now extend the application by integrating additional agents using the Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol.

## Description

In this task, you will extend the Zava Product Manager application to incorporate additional agents using the Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol. This will involve modifying the existing application to enable communication between multiple AI agents, allowing for more sophisticated interactions and improved customer service. With the Semantic Kernel library, you can also create **Plugins** that encapsulate specific functionalities, making it easier to manage and extend the capabilities of your agents.

## Success Criteria

- You have successfully integrated additional agents into the Zava Product Manager application using the A2A Protocol.
- You have created at least one Plugin that adds new functionality to your agents.

## Learning Resources

- [Integrating Semantic Kernel Python with Google's A2A Protocol](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/semantic-kernel-a2a-integration/)
- [Semantic Kernel A2A Travel Agent](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-a2a-travel-agent)

## Key Tasks

### 01: Incorporate new agents

Adding new agents to the Zava Product Manager application is fairly straightforward, as the core architecture is already in place. You will create three new agents in particular, including two in this step. The first will be the **Marketing Agent**, which will handle tasks related to product recommendations, upselling, cross-selling, and improving product descriptions. The second will be the **Ranker Agent**, which will manage product comparisons, reviews, and rankings. Finally, you will modify the existing **Product Manager Agent** to delegate tasks to these new agents as appropriate.

Before continuing, stop the existing application if it is still running. You can do this by pressing `CTRL + C` (or `CMD + C` on macOS) in the terminal window where the application is running.

Navigate to the `src/a2a/agent` directory and open the `product_management_agent.py` file. You will see the existing implementation of the Product Manager Agent. In the `__init__()`  method, there is code that defines a single agent, the `ProductManagerAgent`. Add the following code above the assignment of `self.agent` and below the assignment of `chat_service` in the `__init__()` method:

```python
        # Define an MarketingAgent to handle marketing-related tasks
        marketing_agent = ChatCompletionAgent(
            service=chat_service,
            name='MarketingAgent',
            instructions=(
                'You specialize in planning and recommending marketing strategies for products. '
                'This includes identifying target audiences, making product descriptions better, and suggesting promotional tactics. '
                'Your goal is to help businesses effectively market their products and reach their desired customers.'
            ),
        )

        # Define an MarketingAgent to handle marketing-related tasks
        ranker_agent = ChatCompletionAgent(
            service=chat_service,
            name='RankerAgent',
            instructions=(
                'You specialize in ranking and recommending products based on various criteria. '
                'This includes analyzing product features, customer reviews, and market trends to provide tailored suggestions. '
                'Your goal is to help customers find the best products for their needs.'
            ),
        )
```

{: .note }
> Python is a whitespace-sensitive language, so be sure to maintain proper indentation when adding this code. These chat completion agents should be at the same indentation level as the Product Manager Agent.

These two agents do not make use of any special context or information, so they are defined with only a name and instructions. Next, modify the `self.agent` assignment to include these new agents as plugins. Inside of the `self.agent` assignment, modify the `plugins` parameter as follows:

```python
plugins=[marketing_agent, ranker_agent],
```

This change allows the Product Manager Agent to delegate tasks to the Marketing Agent and Ranker Agent as needed.

### 02: Create a Plugin and another agent

The two agents you created in the prior step are creative in nature: they do not acquire factual information but instead generate responses based on the instructions you provided. In practice, many agents will need to access specific information or perform particular tasks. To facilitate this, you can create **Plugins** that encapsulate specific functionalities. In this step, you will create a Plugin that allows an agent to look up product information from a predefined list.

Add the following code below the **Chat Service Configuration** region and above the **Response Format** region in the `product_management_agent.py` file:

```python
# region Plugin

class ProductPlugin:
    """Retrieve data from Zava's product catalog.

    The Plugin is used by the `product_agent`.
    """

    @kernel_function(
        description='Retrieves a set of products based on a natural language user query.'
    )
    def get_products(
        self,
        question: Annotated[
            str, 'Natural language query to retrieve products, e.g. "What kinds of paint rollers do you have in stock?"'
        ],
    ) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
        try:
            # Simulate product retrieval based on the question
            # In a real implementation, this would query a database or external service
            product_dict = [
                {
                    "id": "1",
                    "name": "Eco-Friendly Paint Roller",
                    "type": "Paint Roller",
                    "description": "A high-quality, eco-friendly paint roller for smooth finishes.",
                    "punchLine": "Roll with the best, paint with the rest!",
                    "price": 15.99
                },
                {
                    "id": "2",
                    "name": "Premium Paint Brush Set",
                    "type": "Paint Brush",
                    "description": "A set of premium paint brushes for detailed work and fine finishes.",
                    "punchLine": "Brush up your skills with our premium set!",
                    "price": 25.49
                },
                {
                    "id": "3",
                    "name": "All-Purpose Paint Tray",
                    "type": "Paint Tray",
                    "description": "A durable paint tray suitable for all types of rollers and brushes.",
                    "punchLine": "Tray it, paint it, love it!",
                    "price": 9.99
                }
            ]
            return product_dict
        except Exception as e:
            return f'Product recommendation failed: {e!s}'


# endregion
```

This code defines a simple Plugin class called `ProductPlugin`. The class contains a single method, `get_products`, which simulates retrieving product information based on a natural language query. In a real-world scenario, this method would likely query a database or an external service to fetch relevant product data, but for the sake of simplicity, it returns a hardcoded list of products.

The `@kernel_function` decorator is used to define the method as a function that can be invoked by the Semantic Kernel. The `description` parameter provides a brief explanation of what the function does. Language models can use this description to understand how to interact with the function.

Now that you have defined a plugin, you can create an agent that utilizes this plugin to handle product-related queries. Add the following agent code in the same area as where you defined the Marketing and Ranker agents, above the assignment of `self.agent`:

```python
        product_agent = ChatCompletionAgent(
            service=chat_service,
            name='ProductAgent',
            instructions=(
                'You specialize in handling product-related requests from customers and employees. '
                'This includes providing a list of products, identifying available quantities, '
                'providing product prices, and giving product descriptions as they exist in the product catalog. '
                'Your goal is to assist customers promptly and accurately with all product-related inquiries.'
            ),
            plugins=[ProductPlugin()],
        )
```

This code defines a new agent called `ProductAgent`, which is designed to handle product-related requests. The agent is configured with specific instructions that outline its role and responsibilities. Notably, the `ProductAgent` utilizes the `ProductPlugin` you just created, allowing it to access the product retrieval functionality.

Finally, modify the `self.agent` assignment to include the new `ProductAgent` as a plugin. Inside of the `self.agent` assignment, modify the `plugins` parameter as follows:

```python
plugins=[product_agent, marketing_agent, ranker_agent],
```

### 03: Try out the application

You now have a collection of agents that can handle a variety of product-related tasks. The Product Manager Agent can delegate tasks to the Product Agent, Marketing Agent, and Ranker Agent as appropriate. You can now run the application and test out the new functionality.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

Navigate to the `src/` directory in your terminal and run the following command to start the application using Gunicorn:

```bash
python a2a\main.py
```

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8001/` in your web browser to access the application.

First, select the option that reads "Make a better product description for the Standard Paint Roller."

![Select the option to make a better product description.](../../media/Solution/0302_A2aApp1.png)

This will send the question to the Product Manager Agent, which will then route the request to the Marketing Agent. You can see these details in the application logs, which are available in the terminal.

![The application logs showing the request routing to the Marketing Agent.](../../media/Solution/0302_A2aApp2.png)

You may need to request more details on the description, as the initial response may simply indicate that the request has been forwarded to the Marketing Agent. You can do this by asking, "Can you provide more details?" or "What is that new description?"

![Retrieve more details on the product description.](../../media/Solution/0302_A2aApp3.png)

Use the following prompts to test each agent in combination.

- "What kinds of paint rollers do you have in stock?" (Product Agent)
- "What other products do you have for painting?" (Product Agent)
- "I like the concept of the All-Purpose Paint Tray, but it sounds too generic. Can you make the description more exciting?" (Marketing Agent)
- "I'm planning to paint a very small box and can only afford to buy one product. Which product would you recommend?" (Ranker Agent)
